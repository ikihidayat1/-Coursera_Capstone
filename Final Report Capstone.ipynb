    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods in Scarborough\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of people are migrating to various states of Canada especially in Toronto Scarborough and needed lots of research for good housing prices and reputated schools for their children. This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. For ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like minded people, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project aim to create an analysis of features for a people migrating to Scarborough to search a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both freash and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life.\n",

    "## Problem Which Tried to Solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "The major purpose of this project, is to suggest a better neighborhood in a new city for the person who are shiffting there and living for long term . Social presence in society in terms of like minded people. Connectivity to the airport, bus stand, city center, markets and other daily needs things nearby.\n",

    "The question is How to find the better neighborhood in Scarborough for long term living?\n",

    "Data Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M \n",

    "## Foursquare API Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need data about different venues in different neighborhoods of that specific borough. \n",
    "In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "After finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 100 meter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n",

    "    1. Neighborhood\n",
    "    2. Neighborhood Latitude\n",
    "    3. Neighborhood Longitude\n",

    "    5. Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant\n",

    "Clustering Approach:\n",
    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm.\n",

    "The Location:\n",
    "Scarborough is a popular destination for new immigrants in Canada to reside. As a result, it is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas in the Greater Toronto Area, being home to various religious groups and places of worship. Although immigration has become a hot topic over the past few years with more governments seeking more restrictions on immigrants and refugees, the general trend of immigration into Canada has been one of on the rise."

    "In this project, using k-means cluster algorithm I separated the neighborhood into 5 different clusters and for 103 different lattitude and logitude from dataset, which have very-similar neighborhoods around them. The model produce the general and initial overview cluster of how much the similar and dissimilar category of neighborhoud. \n",

    "The future worked could be involved another data especially in house price and another category that mostly important feature engineeering in the neighborhood place. In other word, other supporting data is could improve the insight of the model.\n",

    "This is the first step for me to involved in the next real world as a data scientist.I am Iki Hidayat from Indonesia. I hope i getthe best environment in data science and big data especially in Indonesia. It really important for me to get the real project in Indonesia but our country still in progress in data infrastructure especially mostly focus on data source and data preparation.But I hope, the data infrastructure could be better next time. So, the modelling process could be improve significantlty. \n",
